# 🔒 Diving into Android Hacking for Penetration Testing! 🔒

In this project, I took on the role of an ethical hacker to understand and demonstrate the process of compromising an Android device securely and ethically. Here’s a quick overview of what I accomplished:

#### 💻 Payload Development:
Using Kali Linux, I developed a custom payload using msfvenom (android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp).

#### 💣 Delivering the payload to the Victim
This APK file, once delivered to the victim’s Android VM, initiated a reverse connection.

#### 🛠 Exploitation:
After deploying the payload, I set up a TCP handler and successfully gained access to the victim VM, allowing me to explore and analyze the system.

#### 🎯 Post-Exploitation:
Performed crucial post-exploitation activities, including data extraction (like a contact dump) to understand potential impacts on user data.
