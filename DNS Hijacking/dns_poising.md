### Pharming is an online fraud that redirects the victims to a spoofed website in an attempt to steal their credentials and data.

In my recent exploration of C|EH training, I dove into the concept of Pharming.  
This type of cyber attack redirects a user from a legitimate website to a fake one,  
potentially gathering sensitive data without their knowledge!

In this assessment, I successfully performed a DNS poisoning attack in a controlled environment,
redirecting the victim to an attacker-generated page by using 𝙴̲𝚝̲𝚝̲𝚎̲𝚛̲𝚌̲𝚊̲𝚙̲ as the tool. 💻

### Key Highlights:

🔹 Identified and gathered the victim’s IP address and default gateway.  
🔹 Configured 𝙴̲𝚝̲𝚝̲𝚎̲𝚛̲𝚌̲𝚊̲𝚙̲ to conduct the attack.  
🔹 Executed the attack and demonstrated its impact.
