We often hear about hashed passwords being "secure" and "unbreakable." But is that really the case? Let's put this to the test!

In my latest assessment, I demonstrated the power of,
 𝙃𝙖𝙨𝙝𝙘𝙖𝙩 and 𝙅𝙤𝙝𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙍𝙞𝙥𝙥𝙚𝙧, to uncover hashed passwords in a matter of " seconds". Here’s a quick breakdown of what I did:

#### 1️⃣ Using Hashcat, I attacked the SHA-256 hashed passwords in a file named sha256hashest.txt with the infamous 𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘆𝗼𝘂.𝘁𝘅𝘁 wordlist.

#### 2️⃣ I switched to John the Ripper and used its Single Crack Mode to analyze the same hashes. Once again, the results highlighted how weak passwords can be easily exploited.

🔴 Many users still rely on weak or common passwords that are no match for modern cracking tools.

1️⃣ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴, 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝘀𝘀𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀: Ensure your passwords are at least 12–16 characters long and include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
2️⃣ 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝘀𝘀𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿𝘀: Tools like LastPass, 1Password, or Bitwarden can help you generate and securely store complex passwords.
